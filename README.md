### SUMMARY
Original Title: Air Quality Monitoring Station Data - Air Quality Station 4, Wharf Street, Sowerby Bridge

These data files are periodic (15 minutes) measurements of the concentration of nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter in the air for the monitoring station at Wharf Street, Sowerby Bridge. The units are measured in micrograms per cubic metre ( PM2.5 and PM10 are fine particulate matter). Each file shows data for a whole year, the file uses the name R4 for the Air Quality Station 4. The data has been checked and calculations made on them to produce the final result. Data for our other two stations in Hebden Bridge and Halifax can be found on separate datasets. Full reports can be found on the Calderdale website under Air Quality Reports
